# Sorting-Algorithm-Visuals

A Java application that provides a visualization of various array sorting algorithms using rectangles of different sizes. Inspired by [The Sound of Sorting](https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/).

Currently there are 4 algorithms present:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort

Planning to add more algorithms in the future, as well as a visualization for searching algorithms. 

## Instructions 

Before starting the sorting visualization, a sorting algorithm has to be selected and the array has to be shuffled. In order to choose a sorting algorithm, simply click on one from the list at the bottom of the "Algorithm Inputs" Section. After selecting a sorting algorithm, click on the "Reset" button. This will shuffle the array.

Clicking "Run" will then begin the visualization. If the visualization is already running, then clicking the "Run" button will pause it.

The "Delay" slider can be adjusted to change the time between each step. Alternatively, the "Step" button can be pressed to manually advance through each step.

Clicking the "Complete" button will finish the sorting algorithm without any delay, instantly completing the sorting.
